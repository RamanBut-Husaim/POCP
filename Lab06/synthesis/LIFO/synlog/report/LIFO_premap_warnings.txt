@W: MT531 :"e:\embedded\projects\pocp\lab06\src\lifo.vhd":31:25:31:25|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 11 sequential elements including sram_3[1:0].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance.
