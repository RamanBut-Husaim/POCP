@W: MT529 :"e:\embedded\projects\pocp\lab06\src\ram_ham.vhd":23:8:23:11|Found inferred clock RAM_Ham|WR which controls 8 sequential elements including sram[6:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
